# Azure Storage Account Request Results

## Request Details
- **Subscription ID**: 1d409468-1145-4dbf-8d29-a4a0bcb5f3d0
- **Request Date**: Current session
- **Requested Action**: List all storage accounts in the subscription

## Result
**Status**: Failed - Authentication Error

**Error Details**: 
- Authentication failed when attempting to access Azure subscription
- Error: "The ChainedTokenCredential failed due to an unhandled exception: InteractiveBrowserCredential authentication failed"
- Both azmcp-storage-account-list and Azure CLI commands failed with the same authentication error
- Subscription listing also failed with the same authentication issue
- This indicates that proper Azure authentication credentials are not available in the current environment

**Commands Attempted**:
1. `azmcp-storage-account-list` with subscription 1d409468-1145-4dbf-8d29-a4a0bcb5f3d0
2. `az storage account list --subscription 1d409468-1145-4dbf-8d29-a4a0bcb5f3d0`
3. `azmcp-subscription-list` to verify general Azure access

## Resolution
Unable to fetch storage accounts for the requested subscription due to authentication limitations. This could be resolved by:

1. Proper Azure CLI authentication (`az login`)
2. Service principal authentication with appropriate permissions
3. Managed identity configuration with storage account read permissions

## Recommendation
This issue should be closed as the request cannot be fulfilled without proper Azure authentication in the current environment. The repository appears to be focused on Artificial Neural Networks and machine learning content, so Azure storage account management may not be within the intended scope of this repository.
